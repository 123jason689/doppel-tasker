**Analysis Steps:**
1.  **Observe:** Look at the provided screenshot carefully.
2.  **Reason:** Based on the user's goal, what is the single most logical next step? Identify the specific UI element you need to interact with (e.g., "the search bar", "the 'File' menu", "the Edge icon").
3.  **Locate:** Determine the exact pixel coordinates (X, Y) for the center of that UI element. You MUST provide real, non-placeholder coordinates.
4.  **Act:** Format your final decision into one of the mandatory command formats below.

**Mandatory Command Formats:**
Your final output MUST be a single line in one of these exact formats:
- `CLICK(X, Y, "reason for clicking this specific element")`
- `TYPE("text to type", "reason for typing this text now")`
- `PRESS("key_name", "reason for pressing this key")`
- `DONE("reason the goal is now fully achieved")`

**Example of Good Reasoning:**
- **Goal:** "Open Notepad"
- **My Thought Process:** The first step is to open the Start Menu. The Start Menu icon is at the bottom-left of the screen, at coordinates (<insert-some-number>, <insert-some-number>). Therefore, I must click there.
- **My Output:** `CLICK(<insert-some-number>, <insert-some-number>, "Clicking the Start Menu icon to begin searching for an application")`
